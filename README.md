# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project-SpaceX
SpaceX Project

Project background and context.​

The aim of this project is to predict if the falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars, other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of the launch. This information can used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX​

Problems to be addressed​

- What influences if the rocket will land successfully?​

- What is the effect of each relationship of rockets variables on outcomes?​

- What are the Conditions which will aid SpaceX to achieve the  best results?​
